We're following the Git branching model outlined in [this post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
for development. Contact us for write permissions or fork and submit a pull request when you've made your changes. It's
also recommended to test your work against your own install of [Gazelle](http://whatcd.github.io/Gazelle/) instead of
the actual site to avoid any potential issues.

Questions? Contact [Twinklebear](https://github.com/Twinklebear) or [Gwindow](https://github.com/Gwindow/)
through GitHub, the site, or in #whatAndroid on the site irc.

Dependencies
--
- [WhatAPI](https://github.com/Gwindow/WhatAPI) to provide interaction with the site
- We've replace ABS and VPI with the AppCompat support library. We'll likely still use Universal Image Loader but at this early stage it's not needed.
