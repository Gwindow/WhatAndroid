WhatAndroid 2.0 Develop Branch
===========

This branch is for development of the 2.0 version of the WhatAndroid app. It's a full rewrite and we're aiming
to adhere to proper design guidelines and clean up some of the unnecessary stuff in the current version.

Contact Twinklebear in the site IRC or via PM if you're interested in helping!
